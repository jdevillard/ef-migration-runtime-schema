# Overview

`ef-migration-runtime-schema` is a CLI tool that wraps Entity Framework Core command-line tool in order to support changing the schema of the EF Core Migrations at runtime.

The Entity Framework Core command-line tool creates [migration files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/managing?tabs=dotnet-core-cli#add-a-migration) that contain classes where the `up` and `down` methods are designed to reflect incremental changes to your model:

```c#
migrationBuilder.AddColumn<string>(
    name: "FullName",
    schema: "mySchemaName",
    table: "Customers",
    nullable: true);

migrationBuilder.DropColumn(
    schema: "mySchemaName",
    name: "Name",
    table: "Customers");
```

Unfortunately, the database schema name, _e.g_ `mySchemaName`, is hard coded as a string constant throughout the migration files.

The motivation for this project comes from a very good blog post that oulines a strategy to automate the changes required to the EF Core Migrations classes, in order to support specifying the schema at runtime.

## Changing the schema at runtime

In order to support specifying a database schema at runtime to the EF Core Migrations, the `ef-migration-runtime-schema` CLI tool performs the following changes to the generated code:

- Adds a constructor to the migrations classes in order to inject an instance of a custom interface used to retrieve the schema name.
- Adds a new class that inherits from `MigrationsAssembly` in order to support the new constructor.

This allows you to use migrations at runtime with a specific schema BUT you always have to modify your migration class generated by the EF Core CLI.

The idea of this tool is to automated the change in the generated file.

This tool will :

- Wraps EF Core CLI to generate the migration files.
- Opens the migrations file.
- Adds a constructor and required private backing field.
- Updates occurrences of the database schema string constant by references to the private field.

When running this tool, you are specifying a reference to a fully qualified interface that MUST exists at runtime.

You are responsible for supplying the definition for that custom interface like so:

```c#
namespace EfCoreRuntimeSchema
{
  internal interface IDbContextSchema 
  {
    /// <summary>
    /// Name of the Schema
    /// </summary>
    public string Schema { get; }
  }
}
```

The tool can be invoked in one of two ways:

- Using the path to the generated migrations file

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add AddUserName -o <path-to-migrations-file>

ef-migration-runtime-schema \
  --interface EfCoreRuntimeSchema.IDbContextSchema \
  --migrationFile <path-to-migrations-file>
```

- Passing the EF Core migrations `efptions, when generating a new migration
```bash
ef-migration-runtime-schema \
  --interface EfCoreRuntimeSchema.IDbContextSchema \
  --efOptions "migrations add AddUserName -o <path-to-migrations-file>" 
```

The CLIT tool will make the following changes to the migrations file:

```patch
public partial class AddUserName : Migration
{
+   private readonly FullNamespace.Interface _schema;
+
+   /// <inheritdoc />
+   public AddUserName(FullNamespace.Interface schema)
+   {
+      _schema = schema;
+   }

  /// <inheritdoc />
  protected override void Up(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
  {
    migrationBuilder.AddColumn<string>(
    name: "FullName",
-   schema: "mySchemaName",
+   schema: _schema.Schema,
    table: "Customers",
    nullable: true);
  }
}
```
